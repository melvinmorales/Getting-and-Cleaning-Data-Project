# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

The cleanup script (run_analysis.R) does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Running the script

The first step is creating dataset for each training and test set.

After that read the features text and filter the info.

At the end of the script you would have a file with the tiny info for each activity and subject.

For your convenience you have the file in csv and txt format.
